PRINT '''Powerball Lottery, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
Each powerball lottery ticket costs $2. The jackpot for this game
is $1.586 billion! It doesn't matter what the jackpot is, though,
because the odds are 1 in 292,201,338, so you won't win. 
This simulation gives you the thrill of playing without wasting money.
